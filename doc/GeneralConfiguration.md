# General Configuration

SMSLib has some configuration parameters which allow you to alter its behavious without modifying code. All configuration parameters are stored in the class `Settings` as static members. To change them, use the following code:

```
Settings.httpServerACLStatus = "127.0.0.1/32";
```

The majority of configuration parameters can be altered at runtime and have immediate effect. Some parameters are also accessible via `-Dxxxx=yyyy` runtime definitions - those which cannot be modified at runtime. For example, the port to which the internal HTTP server listens to.
